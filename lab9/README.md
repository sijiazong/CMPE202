## Reimplementing Strategy Pattern in Lambda

### Summary
In the Original Strategy pattern source code,an interface for sortingStrategy is used to allow changes of sorting strategy for dataset at runtime. Different sorting strategies need to be implemented as different classes. When implementing in Lambda style, there is no need to implement the same functionality as in classes. 
The number of classes are reduced in Lambda style.
